        print('i am a fake foo')

s = Stub()

                                      check_attributes_also=True)

#==================================================[ Delegation ]
# (see also acceptance/DelegationTests.py)


#----------------------------------------[ replacing an already existing instance ]

#the behaviour we would expect here is that, upon
# calling s.foo, the real foo is called, which
# sets 'aa' on the stub, even though the setting of
# 'aa' happens in real code.

s.foo()

try:
    #this expected behaviour is would have been tested
    # like this:
    assert s.aa == 123
    assert not hasattr(real_instance, 'aa')
except:
    pass

#but alas, we cannot do that...
#
# This problem severely limits the use of Delegates and can
# cause bugs in tests that are very difficult to find, so be
# careful!

#==================================================[ InstanceVariables ]
# (see also acceptance/InstanceVariablesTests.py)

#----------------------------------------[ a misconception about __slots__ ]
# This example was originally posted on comp.lang.python
# by Blair Hall on Apr 10 2003:  (I modified it a bit, though...)

#now, if you used __slots__ thinking that, since 'c' is not in B.__slots__
#  and that the code above would complain, you're in for a surprise...
b = B()
b.c = 3     # passes


#----------------------------------------[ using the class attributes convention ]
class RealClassFollowingConventions(object):
    a = None
    b = None


class Stub(object):
    __metaclass__ = stubclass(RealClassFollowingConventions)
    a = 'asd'

#----------------------------------------[ for the stubborn ]
#  (remove 'aa' from __slots__ to see it complain)

    __metaclass__ = stubclass(StubbornRealClass)

except AttributeError as e:
